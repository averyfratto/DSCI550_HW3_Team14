# DSCI550_HW3_Team14
Through the semester, our team has been working with a dataset including the locations of haunted sightings in the United States. We've enhanced this dataset through multiple methods.

1. We extracted new features by using AI tools to generate descriptions, images, location information, and more of each haunted sighting witness report.
2. We've combined datasets of moon phases, church location data, and alcohol abuse statistics to understand how these variabls can impact paranormal activity.
3. We've used d3 to develop visuals of a subset of our data that help illustrate the many trends we observed when combining and enchancing our features.

Feel free to use the directory to find various aspects of our project, and email afratto@usc.edu for any questions.

Then they will tell you to get out. If you don't leave, you will hear a woman scream bloody murder until you do leave. There is also a white building at the entrance of the cemetery. If you drive in, turn off your car and leave the headlights on, you will see a ghostly figure walk out from behind the building into the graveyard.",

The top floor houses the old Cochise County Jail, where heavy energies and smells can often be detected. The Division 2 Judge's chambers is often the site of strange occurrences and the fleeting scent of cigar smoke. Security Officers opening the building early in the mornings, have reported hearing voices, slamming doors and seeing the apparently headless apparition in a Judge's Robe, floating through the 2nd floor lobby. This apparition is believed to possibly be the spirit of Judge John Wilson Ross, who served on the bench from 1931 to 1943. Numerous reports of paranormal events have been recorded throughout the rest of the building, mostly by the employees who work daily in this building.",

The grave is that of a former Harvey Girl that worked for the Fred Harvey Company. The ghost of a black-caped figure has been seen walking along the pathway leading up from the steps, just to the right of the El Tovar Hotel all along the path. It passes the grave and disappears behind the Hopi House. Although most visitors are unaware, the El Tovar, built in the very early 1900's, is home to more then a few spirits. They say that Fred Harvey appears on the third floor during the holidays and invites people to the annual Christmas gathering held in the hotel. The third floor and the kitchen are the haunted hot spots at the El Tovar Hotel.",

Those that have seen this entity describe it as a male, between the ages of 18-22, that is dressed in garments from the late 40's/early 50's. The spirit seems very territorial, and resides in a small area between/in a small gap in between 2 buildings and a moveable dumpster about 20\" to the right of the gap. \"He\" (by those that have seen him) generally appears to be a full-body apparition and stays stationary until \"his space\" is disturbed. He tends to show is dislike by slamming the lid of the dumpster. 1 witness reports, \"It was completely `pen (folded along the back of the dumpster). As we all turned our backs to the dumpster, the lid slammed closed with incredible force. There was absolutely no wind and no one in the area besides us. Whoever this spirit is, he does not take kindly to strangers.\"",

Anyway today this place is a hangout for kids and bands play here, but people see weird things up in the balcony you see out of the corner of your eye a white figure or a really dark shadow, in the bathrooms you hear things in the bathroom, the balcony is locked so no one can go in there unless a big show. the basement it the worst, if you ask the owner about it he will tell you about the place and if you know the band AFI they have witnessed stuff to, so if you want to check it out go for it! it's an awesome place to get scared in.",

        "description": "The Mission Inn is an older, semi-spooky (yet extremely classy and pricey) hotel. While guests of the Inn may enjoy modern amenities such as an outdoor Olympic sized pool and fitness center, the catacombs that run underneath the building heading in the direction of Mt. Rubidoux are now closed. As one current employee of the Inn remembers, an older gentleman was once given a room in one of the upper stories of the building, as there were no lower floor rooms available due to construction. The next morning, when the gentleman was asked if his accommodations were adequate, he replied, \"All was fine, especially the woman singing beautifully in the next room.\" He was the only tenant on that floor. This place is haunted by the Millers. The Mission Inn Hotel was originally a 12 room cottage where the pool now sits. The existing structure of the hotel was begun in 1900 and completed in a pproximately 1947. Owned first by C.C. Miller and sold to his son, Frank, in 1900. Frank's sister, Alice, managed the hotel until her death in the late '40s.",

In the boys bathroom, there can be heard men talking about legal issues when no one is around and occasionally, a lawyer in a older style brown suit and rugged briefcase can be seen on Christmas day. Windows with latches come undone by themselves, and the windows will open and close and re-latch on its own. Within the Auditorium itself, ghosts can be seen on the upper balcony watching an invisible show. The most noted person was a man in a black suit with a white shirt on; he has dark brown hair and brown eyes, with a black mustache. He is often seen applauding for an invisible show, and once done applauding he vanishes.",

        "description": "The students share a legend of a haunting by saying that one of the bathrooms is haunted. Someone supposedly died there and now you can see her face in the mirror. - March 2007 update/correction. The school was built in the 1920's and it was a six-year school when the new high school was built it took the name Narbone so the old school had to come up with a new name. This is probably all urban myth. There are other stories one is about a elevator that went up to the third floor, but there is no elevator. One thing is that the school was built in the 1920's and that the school's name was changed to honor Alexander Fleming. The submitter does not remember the school's original name but the name change occurred in the 1940's. The third floor can only be reached by a rather steep set of stairs. The third floor was seldom used because of this fact. There is one hallway up there with about 20 rooms in total, 10 on each side of the hall. Some classes where held on the third floor but it was mostly unused.",

        "description": "Students believe the fourth floor is haunted because of it being restricted. any info please email Haunted Places- April 2005 Correction \u2013 The rumor is that a boy was murdered up there in the 4th floor. On the 3rd floor witnesses would hear noises down the hallway, as if someone was touching the lockers. Like someone was trying to open the locker type noise. When the submitter of this update would go to the 3rd floor they always wondered why the stairs that lead to the 4th floor would be caged shut. While they attended that school, not once had they ever seen the stairs that lead to the 4th floor ever cleaned. The 3 yrs they attended the same filth would be there. The school was built sometime in 1936.",

Loud and unexplainable bangs awaken and frighten students between midnight and 4AM in rooms 231, 229, 227, and 225, yet no other rooms in that hallway can hear the noises at all. - November 2003 update/correction: A student that lived in the infamous Dolan 231, reports while they didn't hear any banging, they COULD hear people moving furniture above them. However, when the RA's went up there to tell them that it was 2AM and they were trying to sleep, they found that they TOO were sleeping and not moving furniture at all. The rumor about the nun is NOT true at all, but the room that the student died in IS true and WAS taken offline because of the uncontrollable heat. This room is Dolan 403.",

Upon driving through the park, one may find that there is no fog before entering or after leaving the park, only in the park itself. -There are also tales of the infamous \"Green Eyes\", a confederate soldier killed by his Yankee twin brother, whose eyes can still be seen at night on Snod Grass Hill. An apparition of a soldier walking down the road has been reported. They also say that if you notice him and he notices you, he will stare you down until you are out of sight. There is the tale of the bride-never-to-be who still walks the battlefield in her wedding gown during September and October, visiting the grave of the man she was going to marry, killed during the war.",

Inez was just shy of seven years old when she was struck by lightening at a family picnic. Her parents, distraught over the loss, had a life-size statue of the child erected at her grave site. The statue is enclosed in glass, protecting it from the elements. On rainy nights, when thunder is rolling, the statue reportedly disappears from the glass box, and a young girl can be seen roaming the cemetery grounds.",

They think it happened around 1953 or 54. The Shelton gang and the Burger gang (from down around Springfield Il) were rivals for control of the profits from the downstate crime (South of Chicago). It was a gangland style killing and the hit was supposedly ordered by The Burger gang. At any rate the tavern was a known stop for Bernie at pretty much the same time each day. Many people now claim that the tavern is haunted by Bernie Shelton and there was quite a story in the Peoria Journal Star a couple of years ago where a reporter interviewed the owner and several patrons who swore that the have witnessed experiences of Bernie\u2019s presence in the tavern. -  Febuary 2005 corection: Bernie Shelton was shot with a high powered rifle from the hillside above the tavern on July 26, 1948. He owned the tavern at the time. His murder was never solved, although it was suspected that the Birgers were behind it. The current owner does claim that the establishment is haunted.",

        "description": "Around 1915, the area that is now the Dunes State Park in northern Indiana was mostly uninhabited wilderness. The stories spread around the vicinity of Chesterton, Indiana that fishermen who were along the beach at certain times of the day had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a naked woman swimming in the lake. The story spread that a beautiful woman was living as a hermit along the beach and her notoriety grew to a point that many compared her to the ancient Greek goddess Diana...hence the name of this legendary creature. In truth, her name was Alice Marble Gray and she was the daughter of an influential couple from Chicago. Alice had traveled extensively and was cultured and educated. She had worked in the city as an editorial secretary for a popular magazine, so what had made her take up the lonely life of a recluse. Some have claimed that Alice came to the dunes because of a broken love affair but actually she left the city life because her deteriorating eyesight had made her work impossible. She had sought refuge in the rough land that she had enjoyed as a child. Alice moved into an abandoned fisherman's cottage on the beach and lived a life of peace, borrowing books from the library, walking in the woods and of course, swimming naked in the chilly waters of Lake Michigan. In 1920, Alice met a drifter named Paul Wilson and he moved into the cabin with her. He was an unemployed boat builder with a shaky past but he seemed to make Alice happy and the two of them stayed together until 1922.... when tragedy struck. The badly burned and beaten body of a man was found on the beach and police suspected that Wilson had a hand in the murder. He was questioned but eventually let go. He and Alice moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, where they made a small living selling handmade furniture. Alice bore her husband two daughters but he treated her terribly, often beating her severely. In 1925, Alice died in her home, shortly after the birth of her second daughter. The official cause of death was said to be uremia poisoning...complicated by repeated blows to her back and stomach. Wilson disappeared and later tuned up in a California prison, serving time for auto theft. The fate of Alice's daughters is unknown. Legends of the dunes say that Alice still returns to the beach and the wilderness that she loved so much. Over the years, many have claimed that they have seen the ghostly figure of a nude woman running along the sand or disappearing into the water.",

A janitor haunts the basement where he died of a heart attack several years ago. Many janitors have reported seeing him. Finally, a construction worker haunts the stage area of the auditorium. During the building of the school, it partially collapsed, killing him and injuring many others. It is a little scary walking the halls alone at night. A magazine covered the stories back in the seventies. - October 2004 update: there was contruction that lasted a year or 2 that just finished summer 2004.

When you approach the cemetery don't be afraid if you start to hear the sound of children crying. This is a common occurrence and has been the reason for several Native ceremonies to try to bring peace to these children who died here. One medicine man says that the children will only stop crying when they have been returned to their home lands.",

Sighting of a young boy with dark hair in old fashioned clothing and hat, by main entrance (golf course) but watch out if you see him he will come up to you wanting to go home with you. Local rumors are that he was a victim of a doctor who preformed illegal experiments on his patients. There is also a body chute that is said to be haunted. The chute was used to transport the dead bodies of TB patients who had died so that the other patients wouldn't see them carting all the dead bodies out of the hospital. Many strange figures and noises can still be heard. Over all feeling of dread in the entire building. - January 2007 Additional information.

Cemetery\" - There is supposed to be a witch buried in the Grave yard, there is a house built around her grave and there are times that you can go and the house will be locked. And there are times you will go and the house will not be locked...As you turn on the road it gets very cold even in the Summer time- February 2004 correction \u2013 additional information: Her name was Anna Foster and she died at the age of 28. In the last year or so her headstone has been stolen and the shelter over her grave has been vandalized and almost torn apart. It's sad and the submitter has nearly cry every time they see it. They are looking into fixing the shelter themselves. But they cannot afford to replace her headstone, unfortunately. Upon research they have discovered that she is not the witch everyone thinks. The \"real\" witch's grave is located just inside the woods next to this cemetery. -  Again, we have to state that if you are going to investigate these places, have respect for the people involved with these places. To destroy history, and vandalize graves proves nothing but your foolishness.",

        "description": "Usually during late September or early October, but occasionally at other times, the ghosts of ragged and dirty Confederate soldiers can be seen walking along or crossing Highland Road beginning around Lee Drive (south of the LSU campus) and the sightings continue as far down as Gardere Lane. There are numerous reports of soldiers scurrying across the road late at night. However, in 1999 or 2000, there was an incident in early October in which several drivers called police when a filthy, bleeding young man wearing a Confederate uniform and carrying a rifle staggered across the busy intersection of Lee Drive and Highland Road around 5:00pm. Police serached the area and found no one.",

The story is that a long time ago, in the 1950s, before there were railroad signs there, a family consisting of a mother, father, and two daughters went down that road. Despite the fact of the older girl protesting going down that road due to a bad feeling, the father drove down there anyways and the car got hit by an oncoming train. Reports of seeing orbs and the apparition of the older girl. When you drive down that road, you get a very strong, odd feeling of being suffocated.",

Originally opened in 1920. First the facility treated tuberculosis patients then treated mentally retarded children. Many people have visited this place. You must park down the rail road tracks and walk up behind it. Never enter the front gate. It is to dangerous. Witnesses saw shadows in an old theatre inside the hospital, a women\u2019s dress hanging at the end of one of the long hallways. When they went back, it was gone. There are hundreds of rooms and doors. Outside of one of the buildings on a hill, they saw a rocking chair on a porch (above) still rocking as if the patients were still there. As with all the other closed Maryland Hospitals, It's as if all history of the place was wiped off the map.",

The 200 or so captives were taken North to Canada, along the way crossing over the Green River in present-day Greenfield. Eunice Williams, wife of the town's reverend who just hours before had given birth, was hacked to death in the river by an Indian. Today, a plaque set in a stone tells the tale, and a covered bridge looms beside it connecting North Greenfield and the Meadows section of town. It is said that Eunice shows herself here, at night, when motorists stop inside the bridge, turn off their headlights, and beep once. Other sightings have been beside the dam above the bridge, and downstream in the middle of the river.",

It is over a hundred years old and is the size of a mansion. There is a girl about the age of 6 who runs out of one of the bedrooms at nighttime. She is in a long nightgown and wearing a nightcap. There is another girl downstairs who roams one of the units for the older girls. She just passes through...always at the same time of night. Up on the third floor, furniture is moved around, windows are opened, you can hear footsteps, and in one certain spot on the second floor, right above you, it sounds like somebody dropping something. Outside, only on certain nights...not all the time, on the third floor in one of the windows is a faint blue glow.",

The tree appears to have an arm and a face can be visibly seen on the side. Also there is Dungeon rock, this where cults went to sacrifice people wandering alone in the woods.

        "description": "Mainstage Auditorium - The ghost of a little Boy named Tommy is said by theater professors and students to haunt the auditorium. Tommy is supposedly the ghost of a child that got into the area above the auditorium one night during the '60's. He fell through a spot in the ceiling and was found dead in the seats of the auditorium by a professor the next day. Tommy still haunts the area above the auditorium, which has long been sealed up and used for storage. He is mischievous for the most part, making noises, moving things, and causing unexplainable problems in the theater. Technicians working on tall ladders swear they can feel Tommy putting a pressure on their backs. They claim that it is Tommy trying to prevent any one else from falling. December 2003 correction:The actual story is this: It was in the '70's when it happened, and the boy that fell wasn't a child, he was a teenager.The boy that died was named Tommy. Tommy and few other kids had been drinking and they snuck into the auditorium. They were fooling around, jumping on seats, rolling around on the stage, etc. When the kids where getting ready to leave, but they couldn't find Tommy. They figured that he had left and so they left. The next morning my dad got a call saying that his friend Tommy had fallen through the ceiling of the auditorium. He had fallen head first onto the floor and died on impact.",

Go at your own risk because the place has been known to have many freaky occurrences an not to mention a monks monastery about a mile down the road. - October 2003 Update: The Police DO issue trespassing tickets for $250.00 because the train bridge and tracks are federal property and by being on it you are trespassing on federal property. - February 2004 Update: Police patrol there quite frequently and the neighbor across the street won't hesitate to call them.",

        "description": "The Lamplights Inn has been a landmark in Central Lake since 1924. It was built in the very early 1900s. Beginning in the early '50s, the successive owners have had persistent reports of ghosts. A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fianc\u00e9e, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village. In 1979 Ted Strzempek bought the lamplight he said he was in the upstairs hallway painting when a women in a white dress ran by him and through all the boxes he had stacked by the wall she ran into a bedroom and he ran in after her only to find an empty room. The Murphy's now own the lamplight and if you ask them if the lamplight is haunted they will not deny it.",

In the Conservatory, there have been reports of piano music being played when there is no one in the practice rooms. Folks say that it is Margaret Upton whom the Conservatory is named after. Also there is something in Dole Hall one of the campus dormitories. In the basement when walking away from the laundry room you will feel like something is staring at your back. No reason why this is but there have been different reports of it. Rumor has it that during a period when the cemetery was being moved to make room for the growing college a few bodies weren't found and put into the new cemetery. The old cemetery is where Dole Hall now stands.",

Some say its made out of phosphorous and others say its mercury vapor reflecting off a shiny tombstone. but it doesn't explain why it goes dark when you get within 500 feet. the only close house to it is 1/4 mile away.

Voices are heard by the workers and teenagers who go to this location for a thrill. Many picture of paranormal things have been captured at this location. Lights are turned on and off. Growls and moans are heard by the playground built for the use of the office workers' kids. -  October 2004 Update: Most of it has been torn down. there is still a building standing that people still go to and also there is a cemetary behind it that is actually more haunted then the actual building itself...with only patients numbers on them. Only a few buildings remain on the property of the old Asylum. The D building now known as the Kay Beard building, also the fire house, the power plant and the bakery are all still there.",

Her child had wandered out into the river. The mother heard her child crying and she herself couldn\u2019t swim, but she jumped in anyways. They both drown. Today, if you park on the bridge, you'll get this terrifying feeling. The chills, the shakes. really cold. and legend has it, that if you read the lords prayer backwards while on the bridge, you'll see the mother walking towards you with her waterlogged child in her arms, asking for help. then, the bridge will collapse, and you'll join them in watery death. no ones ever been brave enough to try it.",

Her ghost is said to walk the halls, knocking on doors, and calling for her baby- asking where it is. Shadows are seen under the doors when no one is walking by. During a s\u00e9ance 2 different room numbers where given and one of them was a room that was not used, the other room of a suite used by a community advisor (like an RA). This room\u2019s door looked very different from the rest of the doors, had a sort of- darkness above it. And was very obviously off-limits to residents. Rumor is that the numbers of the rooms in that building had been reassigned so that no one would hear about the room the suicide victim lived in and not want to live in it. This could be just a rumor, though. - October Update: This is the legend of Sarah. An eye witness to both the s\u00e9ances reports the findings were fake \u2013 that nothing happened.",

        "description": "There have been many restaurants and stores in this old building in historic Nebraska city in. Nobody is sure who haunts it, some say it\u2019s the ghost of a boy who died and one of the restaurants was named after him and owned by his parents. Others say its the ghost of the woman who had a antique shop there for many years and cared dearly for the building. Anyone who spends any amount of time there has seen objects moving, strange sounds, and misplaced objects. - December 2003 update/correction: the restaurant used to be a place called Bischofs hardware. they were in business for many. many yeas. A man ran it, there was Minnie Bishof who was the bookkeeper there and she babysat. Mr Bishof ran it until he died at age 90! His brothers helped too along with his sister Minnie. They were a well respected family in town. A family renovated the building and named it Scooters after theirson who committed suicide, it was rumored boy is buried close by where my parents are buried. The boy died well before they opened up the restaurant.",

The man had a heart attack and died one evening, his spirit never leaving the hotel again. People who have worked there for a time will tell you it was nothing for them to feel a cold spot, for a female to feel a touch on her body as she walked through an empty room, and on one occasion, a case of beer floating. The staff at this Inn have affectionately called this ghostly presence George. Most are not frightened by the presence, it seems to be extremely friendly to the ladies, and likes to play practical jokes. But still there are some that say, \"I am never going up those stairs, you can feel \"something\" up there. \"",

About 10-15ft from the area at which the camper's sleep is a steep hill (about 80deg.), with a large creek at the bottom. A boy known as Riley was found at the bottom of that hill in the creek one morning after a campout. He was though to have slept walked off the side of the hill. After his death a healthy cluster of trees started to grow in one knot like tree.

It is also said that once a year during the summer months, residents from the neighboring Indian Reservation will come up to the state lands and disappear into the woods until morning.",

They left the money in their wagon until the morning so they would have time to decide. When the family awoke, the money was gone. Mr. McGreen was so mad that he killed everyone and hung himself in the well. Strange things happened in the house for almost 200 years later. Doors would open by themselves. Pets refused to go into the dining room nor would plants ever live in it. Small fires would start in the fireplace on their own. Door handles would be witnessed as wiggled when no one was on the other side to do so. Shadows are seen and images are seen outside a huge picture window that looks over a river. the well is still there and nothing will grow with in a 10 feet radius of it. In 1979, the house mysteriously burned down without any indication of a cause.",

And Catoosa police department have on file several reports of drivers saying they struck a boy on a bicycle in front of the cemetery gate and even photos of minor damage to the cars but no body has ever been found. also several teenagers trespassing on the wooded lot in front of the cemetery have claimed to have sudden nose bleeds and spot glowing objects above the graves...it is rumored that the cemetery gate has been seen by the caretaker to open itself and several have quit....",

Also stories of the massive chandelier swinging for no reason, and this was a massive thing that you usually see in movies. DJ's have been spooked so much in the past, that they had been known to have locked themselves in the DJ booth while working the graveyard shift. KWJJ moved out of the building a few years back.",

The living residents of a house heard a party going on downstairs. Wishing to investigate, they head down stairs. This house had a sealed up staircase (It had its own room). When they got to the door, they could hear people talking and smell coffee. As they opened the door, the smell and sound disappeared. It reappeared when they returned to their beds.",

There was a witch living amongst the people and they burned her alive, as she died she placed a curse of flood on the place and death on the people. On the anniversary of her death there was indeed a great flood, burying the entire town and people in it alive. if you park your car near the gates at night, a train going across the only way out, blocking you in for an hours worth of demon faces in your windows, howling screeching sounds, corpses trying to get at you, and the like. (Remember, in actuality the corpses are still underwater in the town, never recovered). You can actually walk thru this place (beware, there are wild dog packs throughout) and good luck not getting lost. If the waters low enough, you can see the tops of chimneys and houses during the day. Pay close attention to what you hear; sounds even in the daytime are unexplainable and for added fun, try the cemetery off to the left for gravesites of those who died before the flood. Not recommended for ANY child, the place is dangerous. And don't drive thru there, you will get fined at least $500.For more information check out the Westmoreland Historical Association, and look up Livermore. It's all there in black and white. And yes, the \"Livermore Cemetery\" sign is the original that was used in the black and white version of Night of the Living Dead.",

A local resident reports of a bat who flew in her driver's side window and out the passenger side window while driving the cemetery road as she passed the cemetery. Another report from a substitute teacher and a friend of hers who captured actual photographs of the paranormal from this site and was instructed by a physic to burn these photographs. The ghosts apparently do not wish to be photographed. The dates on the markers date hundreds of years back.

There is a little West Highland White Terrier, named Poogin, who haunts the front of the porch. People will feel something brush up against their leg, or hear little footsteps.

In the late 1820's a diseased midget was outcast for his disability. On his journey from the port city of Georgetown, he was to meet the love of his short life outside of the historic city. When he arrived for his rendezvous he witnessed his mistress hanging in a tree. She was being punished for having performed supposed witchlike experiments in an effort to heighten her lovers stature. It is said that the \"Midget Man\" found his lover struggling for her last breaths, but was unable to reach her to help her escape death's grip. After this experience, \"Midget Man\" lost his sanity and prowled the field until the day of his own death. Pass Georgetown going down HWY 51 turn left on a dark road called Amos. Follow the road. On the left somewhere go into the spooky field. You will see a big scary tree with bark on it. The decaying bark symbolizes his stresses decaying skin, which rotted there over time. Watch for the stumps on the ground that are said to have sprouted from \"Midget Man's\" tears. You know it is the right tree because there is a patch of dark grass in the woods behind it. Walk around the tree three times and reach up to rescue the lady, a vague image of \"Midget Man\" can be seen yonder dancing and cheering due to the release of his lovers soul.",

She was shot by a soldier while trying to save her baby, who was in the wagon with her. People have reported hearing Sarah Jane and also the babe cry while standing on the bridge at night. Here is another explanation of the Sara Jane Haunting... A woman left her abusive husband, so to get back at her, the man took their 5-year-old girl, and jumped of the side of a bridge. The woman searched for the girl for years, and finally got so distraught that she hung herself off the side of the same bridge that her daughter and husband jumped off of. It is said that at midnight, if you drive across the bridge, you can see the noose on the side on the railing and you hear a woman's voice saying, \"Sara Jane, Sara Jane, where are you my Sara Jane\".",

JD Baker died before the house was completed and Charles mysteriously disappeared in 1908. It was purchased by the Fant family in 1940 and reports of ghostly encounters are given by a relative who lived in the house off and on during a 30 year period. She reports seeing shadows on the staircase, feelings of being touched by an invisible hand, seeing ghostly figures and on one occasion the sounds of someone violently pounding the inside of the locked basement door when she was alone in the house. The current owners have had no encounters with any ghostly presence but a worker states that an unseen person tried to push them off the stairs on the second floor.

Though it wasn't at the time, the location is now 24 hours and employees say that at nights Mr. Cedars can be heard walking the store or playing jokes (he likes to knock over the stacks of diapers like he did when he was alive). Several people have reported incidents while alone in the stockroom at night, such as toys turning themselves on and off. Occasionally things have been known to fly off shelves and break without anyone nearby. The activity calmed after the convictions of the perpetrators in 1998, but he is still a presence in the store.",

Back in the early days of the cotton gin, a grounds keeper known to present employees as \"Frank\" supposedly hung himself from the rafters of the vaulted ceiling. He couldn't bear to live without his recently deceased lover. \"Frank\" now roams the restaurant playing practical jokes like turning lights on and off, throwing things off counters, and bumping glasses together. Sometimes you can even hear someone with boots on running back and forth along the upstairs dining area, but when you go and look around know one is there.",

        "description": "Brought from England - Apparitions of a man have been reported. - January 2004 additional information: They say a young man built this castle for his bride to be. The wedding was to be held in the newly finished house, but on the wedding day, the bride was found floating in the lake. No one was sure if she died accidentally or if foul play was involved ...But a few months later the groom married the dead woman's sister. Now, at night, the bride can be seen running from the house, across the road and towards the lake before disappearing. The actual history of the Castle is not quite as dramatic as the ghost stories it has spawned...but in case anyone is curious... The Castle was originally an 1860's rock farmhouse that was purchased in the 1920's by the Whitings. After extensive renovations and the addition of the round crenulated front wing and the rear tower the rambling mansion took on the look of a castle. It was completed in 1938 and Mrs. Whiting, who mostly supervised the renovation, named it \"Inverness\". The residence has seen several owners in the past and at one time Gary Stewart stayed there while filming a movie in the 1950's. In the not so distant past the castle was vacant for a long period of time and was in such disrepair it was on the verge of being condemned. It is now currently occupied and restored.",

The old man's face appeared on one of the grids (there were nine total) the face is a lot like a shadow picture but is quite clearly visible. The story is that the grid where the face appeared was sandblasted to remove the face, only a few days later the face reappeared in a different grid. It is possible that the sandblasting was repeated at least one time with the face appearing yet again in a different spot. The building is quite close to the bay edge of the island and the site is very difficult to see without being on the actual grounds of the building. Someone might be able to see it from the water.",

        "description": "down behind the old Haltom High School (Now its Shannon High) The story goes that a High School boy was killed and thrown down in the creek, a group of kids skipping school and going down by the creek to smoke found his body. This was in the mid 90's. There are two places that he can be heard and one that he has been seen. On nights that the moon is not out if you stop and go under the bridge its really cold and you can hear heavy breathing and moaning. Also if you walk through the woods there at night you can hear breathing and a feeling of being watched. A young man has also been spotted walking along the road that runs parallel to Broadway back in the forest but as you get close to him he disappears.",

People would hear footsteps in the old kitchen hallways downstairs, beer bottles would mysteriously break and/or fly across the room in the basement. Bartenders would hear doors slam downstairs after the bar had closed and they were the only ones there. Once long after everyone had left, a bartender was getting ready to leave when he shouted \"ok everybody out\" jokingly knowing he had already cleared the bar of people. At that instance, a man stood up from his chair, shook out his coat and proceeded to walk to the door, where he disappeared completely. That bartender left and never worked again. It is one of the oldest buildings in town, and it is rumored that a man hung himself there in the early 1900's.",

He also used to watch CNN all the time, and no one was allowed to change the station on the television. When the workers walk out of the room with a certain channel on the TV, they come back only to see CNN on the screen. No one that works there watches that.

From the road, you can see every detail of that hotel. This hotel is surrounded by woods and across the street is also wooded. Its a three story hotel, all but abandoned, you can't get to the third floor anymore because of holes in the stairway. Third floor has reported to have cold hands applying pressure to their back. If you flash your light at a second floor window they flash back at you. In the basement, feelings of being threatened. The name \"Hotel Hell\" came from the blood on the walls and the yelling from the basement, the ring of the bell and the sound of wheels. The smell of sewer gas is still there in the bathrooms. Old books were in one of the rooms upstairs, burst into flames.- January 2004 update/correction - these caves are right below hotel hell. you will hear moaning as of creatures or monsters there. Witnesses have heard laughing, have seen a little girl in a black dress wearing no shoes on the stairs which go into the caves area. you can hear singing there day or night. near the old stables, visitors have been chased by white light which some of them have seen as a carriage drawn by white horses. also in the old stables the sounds of horses hooves have been heard. The submitter of the update has done some research into hotel hell and it may never have been owned by Al Capone. the first thing to be built there was a \"resort\" built in the 1800's which was one of those places where people went to be cleansed by the natural spring water which still runs pure and clear there today. when you walk the trails there (it's still open to the public) there is one cave door which has been partially opened due to a rockslide, spring water still runs there.",

The grounds keeper called Indian Joe would not let them, so they ran him over and built the road over him. If you drive down the road which is up hill both ways and stop at the bottom, put your car in neutral Joe will push you up hill to the end of the road. If you put flour or any powder on the back of your car you will see the handprints after the push. - February 2004 Update: If traveling South on WI 55 its a quarter mile from a hotel on the right and it will be your first right on a road after Co Tk F. The submitter tried it and it is a real \"Gravity Hill.\" They report no handprints on the back of their truck though. Thinking it was a fluke they turned around and tried to roll down the hill from midway up and i went happily rolling backwards up the hill into 30 mph headwind! The road isn\u2019t all to tricky to find but coming from Lakeshore Drive and 55 the road ID signs have been removed, by either locals trying to keep people from trying the hill or by vandals.",

Several people walking through the park at dusk of later have reported feeling watched, the hairs on the backs of their necks standing up. Looking into the large picture window on the second floor, many have seen a woman in white staring down at them. The sound of coughing can also frequently be heard--undoubtedly the spirits of TB victims still coughing up blood and mucus.",

        "description": "there have been many strange and unusual happening in the building, mostly at night when a lonely deputy is on duty making copies in the office or just simply sitting down and having a cup of coffee, Report seeing people out of the corner of their eye when the building is empty. He shook it off again and went back to his reports when suddenly he turned around and there standing in front of him was an old man wearing a blue bathrobe and blue slippers. He said the old man just looked up at him and turned around and walked out.. The deputy, not realizing what had just happened, followed the man out the door, but when he reached the hallway, there was no one to be found! Another unexplained happening happened around the same time when the Emergency Management Director was sitting in his office early in the morning and was drinking a cup of coffee when suddenly someone slapped the back of his chair and sent him flying up on top of his desk! When he turned around to investigate, he realized that no one was in the room with him, let alone, no one was even in the building at the time of the event!",
